Profesor	Facultad de Medicina	45-54 años	Teléfono móvil,	7	No	It is a consultation and learning tool	In all academic consultation tasks	In games	positive if it exists as in all good use is highly recommended	The impact has not yet been evidenced, some study should be made
Profesor	Facultad de Ingeniería	45-54 años	Computadora,Teléfono móvil,	4	No	One more tool is available to perform different tasks in which it can be coupled.	Quick and simple explanations, complement to the work done, curiosity.	Definitive medium of consultation, task replacement.	Similar to the use of other technological tools according to the need that arises. For example, at the beginning of Zoom pandemic, it was the most important.	It has not made significant changes, however it has become a new possibility of consultation and assistance.
Profesor	Facultad de Ciencias Exactas y Naturales	25-34 años	Computadora,	7	No	It is a revolutionary tool that we must learn to apply it in our professional day.	Preparation of summaries. Rain of ideas. Generation of exam questions. Approach to didactic situations.	Precise and verified information search.	Very good.	It has potentiated, dynamized and simplified some activities, but it should continue to be able to better use it.
Personal Administrativo	Facultad de Ciencias Exactas y Naturales	25-34 años	Computadora,Teléfono móvil,	5	No	If you know how to ask you, it is a tool with high academic potential	Information search, correction of code errors in Python or R and in generation of ideas.	Personal recommendations (diets, exercise routines, etc.)	An AI is always good since it speeds up the different processes that are carried out in the university.	Although it is limited above all in search of updated information, it is very useful in aid with programs used in the field of science, even more when you are asked specific and very specific questions.

Profesor	Facultad de Ciencias Humanas	35-44 años	Solo me han reenviado ejemplos de uso ,	1	No	Extremely interesting to understand as a subjective and collective social and identity phenomenon, as well as the object of key study to glimpse changes in the necessary academic competences of graduates and graduates.

Profesor	Facultad de Ingeniería	55-64 años	Computadora,	1	No	Personally I think that the GPT chat and other artificial intelligence tools is changing the world, it has a positive and negative impact.	The few times that I have connected is to consult on specific topics of cutting -edge technology, especially software and process management methodologies and tools.	I do not see useful in requesting the chat GPT to think of specific issues to speak or expose as their own ideas, this is antietic and great risk not to strive to reason oneself.	Within the university I see that teachers and students consult subjects of subject content to complement the academic material.	While the chat GPT is a great tool for many things, especially for the creation of quality content, for me it is a disadvantage against what students do, for example in one of the subjects I dictate, students enter the Chat GPT and generate source code to solve problems that I ask to do, of course I realize and it saddens me because they no longer want to think, analyze, reason, it wants all this soft one done, it is the May danger to students.
Profesor	Facultad de Ciencias Exactas y Naturales	45-54 años	Computadora,	5	No	It seems to me a good tool, as long as it is used to improve your own creations or generate academic instruments.	Help in the summary of texts, in writing improvement, in suggestions of student work issues, generation of rubrics or other evaluation instruments. Suggestions of Excel or Code functions in certain programming packages.	Searches for scientific or academic information.	Limited still, in evaluation instruments. I find it dangerous to use this and other artificial intelligence tools by students, which has led me to think about alternative forms of evaluation that dispense with its use.	I have shortened the working time in certain tasks.
Estudiante	Facultad de Ciencias Humanas	17-24 años	Computadora,	2	No	As a human science student, it can be a tool that helps in a hurry, however it limits our capabilities of understanding and criticism, since it has all the information and can process it without problem, and that our work is the majority essays , articles or papers This tool has the ability to do such jobs, which is also a challenge for us as academics.	When I can't read a whole text, it helps me with examples to understand the book and summary.	When asking for graphics.	It has been good and very measured, since I have not wanted to get used to having the information easy.	If you have a significant impact for the ease of use and the scope it has at the time of doing a job.
Personal Administrativo	Facultad de Jurisprudencia	25-34 años	Computadora,	7	No	It seems to me that it is a fairly useful tool that serves as a kind of personal assistant.	To write emails, documents and reports. As well as to make precise consultations about information that requires in a moment.	To write letters or missives that are more personalized.	Quite useful.	Not much, since the large part of activities already performed on my own.
Personal Administrativo	Direcciones Administrativas	25-34 años	Computadora,Teléfono móvil,Tableta,	5	No	Is quite advanced for your time	Generation of basic programming	Software development and consultations of some specific data	It has saved me some time, but if there is a lot of development for some things	Helps me as an assistant
Profesor	Facultad de Medicina	45-54 años	Teléfono móvil,	1	No	It could be very useful for concrete tasks, but not as a teaching-learning tool	Summaries or punctual information on a specific topic	Teaching-learning in Faculty Students	none	It is very possible that students limit themselves to the information that this tool provides and that limits their research and reasoning capacity.
Profesor	Facultad de Comunicación, Lingüística y Literatura	55-64 años	Teléfono móvil,	1	No	I would never use it. I am against the use of chatbots.	I've never used it	In none, because I have not used it	None.	"No way. I think teachers should not use it. The time will come when the technology ""thinking""."
Personal Administrativo	Direcciones Administrativas	35-44 años	Computadora,	2	No	It is the best discovery	GENERAL INFORMATION OF SPECIFIC THEMES	In the search for updated information	very good	has influenced positively
Profesor	Facultad de Ciencias Humanas	45-54 años	Computadora,Teléfono móvil,	1	No	In my work it is unnecessary because I fear risking the originality of my work.	I do not use it	Does not apply to me	None	In no way, I have not considered using it because I prefer to find the sources of information to prepare my work
Profesor	Facultad de Comunicación, Lingüística y Literatura	45-54 años	Computadora,	4	No	It seems to me a very useful tool. However, at the moment it presents two main edges. On the one hand, the generality of the information it generates. On the other, users (students basically) do not evaluate this generality and take it as knowledge and absolute and precise information. GPT is a (still) tool, Human beings must process information and content.	In search and organization of information. It also works well as a style concealer.	In very specific topics research. I have requested information with reference sources, for example, and references are usually invented.	It is still anecdotal. In fact, I cannot enter the GPT on the campus. I do not know why. It is surely for ITP. At home it works well.	At the moment, it is very soon to be able to evaluate. However, for the final exam of my subject, which consists of writing a final online trial, I will request that it be done in person because some students have begun to deliver synthetic texts created by an AI.
Personal Administrativo	Facultad de Jurisprudencia	35-44 años	Computadora,	1	No	I would like to meet her, to know how to use this tool	I do not know yet	Don't know	None	None
Profesor	Facultad Internacional de Innovación PUCE – Icam	45-54 años	Computadora,	4	Si	It can be a useful tool if you know how to use and take advantage.	To propose the structure of a document.	The information is simple, valid and common, but it does not serve as the only document.	Good	Students must be guided and accompanied in the use of this tool, so that it is useful and practical
Profesor	Facultad de Ingeniería	45-54 años	Computadora,	8	No	It is a tool that helps a lot as an assistant to complete tasks and search for answers.	Text writing and programming.	In which it is required as answers made. In these cases the AI ​​model is not optimal.	I use it as another work tool.	I would say neutrally. Personally I am Early adopter of many technologies. Chatgpt is so alone one more tool of the many I use.
Profesor	Facultad de Ciencias Exactas y Naturales	45-54 años	Computadora,Teléfono móvil,	4	No	When well used, it can be a useful support for teaching	Information search, elaboration of text synthesis or study aid (flashcards)	Consultations on specific topics that are lent to confusion if the script provided to chatgpt is not clear	Interesting, it has been a positive experience to see students use it with criteria	None, I have used it to know the tool and see how it works
Personal Administrativo	Direcciones Administrativas	25-34 años	Teléfono móvil,	1	No	It is a curious tool that depending on the user can be used for plagiarism or falsification purposes	entertainment	philosophy	fun	No impact
Profesor	Facultad de Arquitectura, Diseño y Artes	45-54 años	Computadora,Teléfono móvil,Tableta,	2	No	An open way of accessing important and immediate information on various topics.	Organization of classes, clarification of concepts, comparison of criteria and theories.	I have not faced this situation.	I have not used it at the university. I use it in the nights occasionally from my home.	It has allowed me to deepen complex issues and organize knowledge.
Profesor	Facultad de Ciencias Exactas y Naturales	45-54 años	Computadora,	1	No	It can be an excellent tool to save time when used with objectives directed to learning, however its misuse can lead to impoverishing the quality of education	I do not use it, I have only explored how it works since I have found jobs done by students with this tool	Tasks focused on data or processes analysis end up being a collection of outdated and imprecise data (which shows the AI) that therefore do not contribute to the development of the student's analysis and discussion capabilities	I do not use it	At the moment I have only seen misuse by students
Profesor	Facultad de Medicina	35-44 años	Computadora,	5	No	Any technological advance that helps optimize time is welcome, the difference is to know how to use it, in my experience as a teacher when using it, some aspects must be validated, because not everything is true of what is obtained.	In the medical field, seeking to improve evaluation methodologies.	There is still no specific software development of the medical area.	It helps optimize time, provided that a specific topic is already dominated, the errors that there are, by validating for example when you request that you prepare questions for an evaluation, come with errors and I can correct them. It also does not argue the correct answer of those requested clearly.	If the tool is known, it is very good. I am lucky to have a computing phd that dominates the subject and helps me in what I want to get. Therefore, if you want to include positively in learning, they must be trained with qualified personnel on the subject.
Profesor	Facultad de Enfermería	45-54 años	Computadora,	5	No	It is an effective and rapid tool that supports the consultation of various situations not only academic.

Interesting to discover potentialities and try to locate it as a tool or replacement.	He has facilitated things.
Profesor	Facultad de Comunicación, Lingüística y Literatura	35-44 años	Computadora,	1	No	Unreliable in its sources and nothing reliable in the links that it recommends	To summarize long or poor writings, extensive academic articles, etc ...	Search for reliable sources, correct quotes, reliable sources, etc ...	My students thought that with copying and hitting what Chat GPT said they could approve the subject	At the moment it has not influenced. I consider that you still lack development.

Profesor	Facultad de Arquitectura, Diseño y Artes	35-44 años	Computadora,	1	No	"It can be useful to collect some basic information and clarify ideas, but the questions must be very precise to prevent the chat from ""inventing"" unlikely answers."	To consult about authors who deal with one or the other topic.	When the questions are very open. The bot tends to confuse disciplines.	To some extent, it is interesting and can help us to guide us. However, it does not prevent you from inquiring more information to corroborate Bot responses.	I have not used it to prepare classes, nor do I think I would. I consider that, instead of wearing myself finding the best way to ask for something like that, I could do it with less effort. However, if I want to get authors to consult a specific issue, I think it is very good as support.
Profesor	Facultad de Psicología	55-64 años	amistades,	2	No	Excellent if you know how to use.

At the time of writing emails, collecting specific information and also solving problems of the different services of the university.	At the time of writing extensive things due to the bad writing and repetitive words used by chatgpt.	Sometimes good and bad because in some cases you cannot connect or cannot access services.

Chatgpt has helped me a lot within the academic field, in my case being an engineering student with various tasks, programming, and even with English work.	There are situations in which Chatgpt is a bit inaccurate, and therefore I have trusted myself a lot in their answers that do not always convince other humans.	Very pleasant, it is a tool that the truth would have liked to appear much earlier.	It has helped me with many things in the subjects of my last semester, including my thesis, and gives me a lot in duties or evidence.

I do not find it useful for the search for scientific articles and very old information.	So far, for the tasks I have used, the experience has been positive.

The paradigm of society really changes.	To solve general doubts or when my mind is blank I use it as a base and then polish it.	The free version of Chat GPT is not so good in the mathematics section still makes some mistakes. Likewise, it is limited for text and images, but I still believe that multimodality will arrive sooner or later.	N/A	It has given me the opportunity to simplify tedious tasks and in some cases obsolete of the education paradigm.

Estudiante	Facultad de Ciencias Humanas	17-24 años	Computadora,Teléfono móvil,	1	No	I consider that chatgpt is a double -edged sword, since although it is a tool that we can use in favor for learning, it can also become a mechanism that promotes facilism in the field of education, eroding such important things as critical thinking and argumentation.	Personally, I have not used chatgpt. But I consider that it can help in the search for information and/or synthesis of it.	At the time of writing essays or argumentative texts. I consider very little useful, or even very negative to use chatgpt in these contexts.	I have not used chatgpt.	I have not used chatgpt.
Estudiante	Facultad de Comunicación, Lingüística y Literatura	17-24 años	Computadora,	4	No	It is a tool that helps minorize the time you take for a job. However, it is not 100% reliable.	When I want to find keywords of a text, or translate a language that is not English.	When certain idiomatic phrases erroneously translates	I have not had bad experiences. I recognize that using artificial intelligence to perform tasks is considered a serious fault in the university. Even so, I have a partner who used the chat GPT to correct the spelling faults of his essay and when he delivered it, the teacher told her that her essay had 100% plagiarism in Turnitin, then she had a zero rating.	I feel that sometimes it makes me useless and less efficient.

Profesor	Facultad de Arquitectura, Diseño y Artes	45-54 años	Computadora,	3	No	It is what it is: a language tool that improves day by day in its benefits, but that by not having awareness associates anything with anything. According to the subject, the result can be boring, basic or distorted. No turns. obedient as a machine. it's a machine. Without spark. Without ingenuity. bourgeois and correct. Very far from the reality of life. However, it offers basic information quickly and orderly	Write emails or answer to the previous question	Write fiction texts	Little stimulating.

Profesor	Facultad de Ciencias Exactas y Naturales	45-54 años	Teléfono móvil,	1	No	It is a tool that allows you to find a response to many questions, however, it must be discerned well regarding the answers, since the information provided has not necessarily has the right data or it refers strictly to what you want to obtain.

It is a support to optimize time and generate new teaching perspectives
Profesor	Facultad de Jurisprudencia	45-54 años	Computadora,	2	No	It seems to me a useful tool to provide a draft of something that must be reviewed and polished.	Prepare a welcome speech.

I will see it in the third partial when they must raise tests, let's see if the turnitin tool is detected.

Profesor	Facultad de Jurisprudencia	45-54 años	Computadora,	5	Si	From the webinar carried out by the CEDIA Virtual Education Unit, with respect to the application of ChatgPT, I learned to use it for the design of evaluation instruments, which, I estimate that it has allowed me to optimize the creation time in at least one sixty to seventy percent. In this sense, it is like having a personal assistant with a high level of knowledge and high capacity to solve problems in seconds. What I could take four hours to design, now I could elaborate it in a maximum of an hour and also, once Chat GPT understands the context of the information and the objective of the activity, can generate multiple options of examples or cases, in seconds , which was unthinkable until before knowing how to use Chat GPT.	I use it specifically in the educational field for the design of acting activities in class, for example, the creation of cases for the simulation of audiences through the role play, And, the generation of multiple option questions with a true answer in which the correct answer also tells me and writes the feedback of why that is the correct answer. Then, valid the information and verify the coherence and congruence of the contents, And, I have been able to generate many more tools in the third part of the time that would take me doing it from scratch with the consequent mental exhaustion. It has been a substantial positive change in the development of these inputs.	In the domain of current legal norms, which includes the recognition of the updated texts or the renovated articles. Since its database or information source is limited to 2021, so, it has not responded exactly or correction when I asked about the application of regulations in force in the legal framework of Ecuador. Nor has it been possible that you find information that was in repositories such as the judicial proceedings of the judicial function or in the sentences search engines of the National Court of Justice or the Constitutional Court.	In the context of use through the university system, such as, for example, through the Wi -Fi system of the library that is where I usually work, my experience has been that, Chat GPT becomes very slow or simply no longer no longer He answers or responds and you have to enter the website again to start the interaction for obtaining the information.	On the one hand, it has allowed me to clarify methodological concepts according to the current currents of education and instructional design, since, although I have several years of teaching experience, I am not a teacher of profession but a jurist, On the other hand, it has helped me to have better ideas in the creation and planning of activities that allow me to identify the fulfillment of the learning results in the students, Likewise, it has allowed me to design better evaluation instruments with a writing without spelling errors, correct and clear syntax, And, having inputs for instant feedback about motivation about the right answers.
Profesor	Facultad de Psicología	45-54 años	Computadora,	1	No	necessary to know and learn to use it as another technique in class	Information in general	specific information	I try not to use it	Yeah. At the moment I have paused the tasks under written essay.
Profesor	Facultad de Ciencias de la Educación	45-54 años	Computadora,	3	No	It is helpful for an orientation, however the document must be reviewed	I have not applied it with the students.	I have not used it	My experience is limited, I have started knowing it	In some cases it has been seen that students supply their own creation and research and trust what this robot created.
Profesor	Facultad de Jurisprudencia	35-44 años	Computadora,Teléfono móvil,	3	No	It scares its potential. It is excellent for certain tasks. It has to be assumed and implemented accelerated in the educational system.	Preparation of class exercises. Information generator.	Those that need current information and real -time connection with the Internet.	Amazing. I should use it more.	I don't think it has still influenced much: it just starts to be used.
Profesor	Facultad de Ciencias Administrativas y Contables	45-54 años	Computadora,Teléfono móvil,	5	No	Awesome	Consultations to an expert on every subject	None	It does not work, it seems to me that it is blocked.	Contribution to the learning process
Profesor	Facultad de Arquitectura, Diseño y Artes	35-44 años	Computadora,Teléfono móvil,	8	Si	It is a tool that allows you to initially write text documents and spreadsheets that are subsequently reviewed and enriched for the purpose defined in teaching activities.	In the writing of cards, certificates, reports, spreadsheets, budgets, schedules, evaluations, case studies.	Specifically in the use of updated information, because ChatGPT has as a restriction a database to June 2020	Very positive. It is another tool to teach that is enriched with personal dynamics within the classroom together with students in learning processes.	"As an artificial intelligence -based language model, ChatGPT is a useful tool that can be used to complement and enrich the educational or work experience in the university. For example, ChatGPT can help students and teachers find relevant and reliable online information, to answer specific questions about a wide variety of topics and provide useful suggestions and recommendations in a variety of situations.

In addition, ChatGPT can also be used to generate quality content, such as reports and academic works, as long as the information provided is reviewed and verified. In this sense, Chatgpt can be a valuable tool to increase efficiency and productivity at work and studies.

These two paragraphs obtain it from Chatgpt and their writing is in general terms it is satisfactory.

I can add that as an educational experience the code of ethics of our university, which is essential for the responsible and critical use of this and similar technologies that generate third -party content."
Profesor	Facultad de Medicina	65 años o más	Computadora,	1	No	Wonderful application. Variable utility, dependent on the area in which it is used. Unpredictable future now but will revolutionize many things.	I have only tried it. In my specific field I detected errors that recognized them and amended	I don't know. We need to use it.	Nor guna	Nothing yet
Personal Administrativo	Direcciones Administrativas	55-64 años	Computadora,	3	No	"The free version is restricted, it is not updated, therefore the free service is not good.
"	Bibliography search	Investigation	Regular	Has not produced any effect
Profesor	Facultad de Medicina	45-54 años	Computadora,	5	No	It is an interesting tool.	At the moment we are analyzing the information that tells patients about a disease. It is easier than the one used by the doctor.	So far none	I still don't use it at the University	none
Profesor	Facultad de Enfermería	55-64 años	Computadora,	10	No	As long as it serves as a guide for critical analysis	When I want to see response multiplicity	When a consultation is sent	None	Hardly ever
Profesor	Facultad de Ciencias Exactas y Naturales	55-64 años	Computadora,	2	No	It can be a help tool for the teaching process, however I believe that it allows facilism to students, which with the minimum effort want to carry out their academic activities.	On complex issues	For trivial consultations	I don't use it too often	In no way, I think it is a tool, but when sending jobs to students it is necessary to evaluate their approach.
Profesor	Facultad de Medicina	55-64 años	Computadora,	1	No	I don't know her	I don't know her	I don't know her	I don't know her	Don't know
Profesor	Facultad de Ingeniería	45-54 años	Computadora,Teléfono móvil,	5	No	One more tool that allows you to perform tasks better, than if they were done without it.	Complement ideas, request texts, make translations.	"Whenever I used it I have found it useful. If the question is focused on ""there is any time when its use has been poor, or it has not been what has expected? Then there is no time."	Positive and negative. Students try to misuse, but it is relatively easy to realize when they have used it.	"Like most computational tools. With an introduction to the academic aspect and a range of possibilities that increases according to time and learning for use.
But in the same way as most tools, something collaborates novelly with great possibilities, without being what many consider the panacea."
Personal Administrativo	Direcciones Administrativas	45-54 años	Computadora,Teléfono móvil,	3	No	Well used, it is a very interesting tool, for the daily development of work	In classes and in professional life	Does not apply	Good	In a good way
Profesor	Facultad de Ciencias Humanas	55-64 años	Computadora,	2	No	An opportunity to find information	To generate paragraphs of the importance of a subject.	I can not answer	I have not used it much.	I know that not everyone uses and that many do not know the use of the tool.
Profesor	Facultad de Ingeniería	55-64 años	no uso,	1	No	It must be used responsibly, it is a tool	I do not use it	I do not use it	I have not used it	No influence
Profesor	Facultad de Ingeniería	45-54 años	Computadora,	1	No	It is a tool that must be used in classes, always taking care that students see it as an assistant to elaborate material that explains their tasks or jobs. We must take care that students know the theoretical foundations behind the products generated using chatgpt.	In questions that briefly know a topic, in systems engineering specifically, there is a question about the new advances in technology, with the help of chatgpt students can quickly have a notion on the subject.	When you want critical reasoning in students. To be able to argue criticism in a topic, good knowledge must be had, this is achieved based on the experience and cognition of each student. For example: in programming, students can ask ChatgPP to do a program to solve a specific problem and deliver it as their own elaboration, but when they are asked to explain why it has used determines programming sentence or logic, many cannot do it efficiently , due to the lack of previous knowledge.	I have not used it at the university.	I am in a learning phase to be able to adapt it in my classes.
Profesor	Facultad de Ingeniería	35-44 años	Computadora,	2	No	Good, simplify the time taken to consult information	Consultations on general topics with prior knowledge	Diagrams	Neutral, I am not convinced that it can be applied appropriately	I still don't see the results
Profesor	Facultad de Arquitectura, Diseño y Artes	55-64 años	Computadora,	8	No	It is research aid	For information search	In the use of students' work because they do not check what the chatgpt gives them	To search for classes	Help to research and knowledge
Profesor	Facultad de Ingeniería	45-54 años	Computadora,Teléfono móvil,	8	No	I think it is a very useful tool that can serve as a first approach to specific concepts or knowledge	New concepts, code structures	Makes errors in software coding confusing libraries	It is a very useful tool	It generates a new source of consultation
Profesor	Facultad de Ciencias Exactas y Naturales	25-34 años	Computadora,Teléfono móvil,	8	No	As teachers, we must use the benefits that this tool brings us and integrate it into our classes.	Generation of questions, approach to learning situations, resolution writing.	None	Very good	Some processes must be rethink, mainly the way to evaluate students.
Profesor	Facultad de Ingeniería	35-44 años	Computadora,	1	No	Provides guides	It helps me correctly cite bibliography	For bibliographic quotes	Interesting tool that can limit the teaching -learning process a lot	I think it's still soon to say it but you must control
Profesor	Facultad de Ciencias Humanas	45-54 años	Niguno,	1	No	It can be useful in few very well defined contexts, but I have serious doubts that substantially enriching the teaching-learning processes.	Maybe to request some summary of something we require, but even in this case there are other better alternatives in Le Red	Tasks, essays, etc.	I have not used as a teacher although I am familiar with her	He has not influenced anything, if he has put me alert about his negative uses.
Profesor	Facultad de Arquitectura, Diseño y Artes	45-54 años	Computadora,	3	No	Useful. It allows to confront ideas and adjust text proposals. I see it as a personal style concealer. It worries me that young people see it as an easy way out of homework and that they have no distance to use it to grow at an intellectual level	Write emails, order ideas. Adjust texts to a number of words. Exercises in the Finding Verification Classroom.	Updated bibliography	satisfactory The issue is what is the utility that the new generations will give you	"It fills me with concerns about its use by new generations.
In my case, my training and profile make me find how to grow with it, But a student who wants to have good notes ... will only use it to answer. In my reasoned questionnaires I identify who used the tool and only copied and hit and those who worked the text. The students asked me how I realized and showed them from the discourse analysis that they do not write that way, that this is not their style. but that is not enough. I think we must speak openly and clearly about the tool and generate forms of collaboration and evaluation of the results it throws, how to integrate them into our processes"
Profesor	Facultad de Economía	55-64 años	Computadora,	1	No	It can be useful for mechanical or repetitive work, but it is not a tool that can do analysis.	It can be very useful for writing the programming lines that are required in statistical and economy programs. Eventually it could also serve to find bibliography.	I asked the Chatgpt answer to a question that I made to the students in a reading control and the result was insufficient.	I still can't make a criterion	I have added reading controls to the topics that I send to investigate with the purpose of discouraging the use of these tools to prepare jobs, assuming that they can serve.
Profesor	Facultad de Ciencias Exactas y Naturales	45-54 años	Teléfono móvil,	4	No	A tool with great benefits	order my ideas	In generating personal opinions	I have not yet used in university applications, I have only used to organize personal ideas.	It helps me organize work effectively
Profesor	Facultad de Medicina	35-44 años	Computadora,	3	No	It is a tool that provides brief and founded information on particular issues, It seems very useful for clearing simple and complex doubts.	When I have doubts about unknown issues for me, since I am offered the possibility of accessing the sources from which he obtained the information in order to deepen a topic.	To make content summarized briefly.	I have carried out the activities (forums, tasks) assigned to the students using chatgpt to identify the quality of responses issued artificial intelligence, evidencing that it is quite complicated to differentiate an answer made by chatgpt or the student. In that context it becomes essential to have tools that detect the use of AI.	Being a teacher in virtual environments, in inverted classroom modality, The evaluation is carried out on the assigned activities/tasks, which can be run quickly in chatgpt.
Profesor	Facultad de Ciencias Humanas	35-44 años	Computadora,	1	No	In my opinion it must be regulated. For now you could take advantage of its use and even suggest training to teachers to guide students and take advantage of it.	To access specific academic bibliography	The GPT chat does not prospect	Positive when you know how to take advantage of it	Not having clear parameters in the U becomes a tool that motivates plagiarism and discourages its own production.
Profesor	Facultad de Ciencias Administrativas y Contables	55-64 años	Computadora,	4	No	It is a tool that must be used with caution and additional validation	Resolution of problems, definitions and scientific concepts	decision making	You can get information and concepts quickly	The research universe has been expanded and an effort must be made to use new and various knowledge

In matters that require reasoning, especially mathematical reasoning. ChatGPT is able to defend its position even when it makes no sense and is able to create sources that do not exist.	I have had a good experience using chatgpt as a quick solution to my questions and as a guide for the writing and rapid development of my works. Even so, I have always modified and manually rectified the information proposed by the AI.	Although I expected the influence to be greater, it has actually served a role similar to that of search engines such as Google, with the addition that IA provides better organized information although, sometimes, not true.

I use it personally for information such as creativity, to help me think about dynamics to do in class presentations or sometimes as research since sometimes there is not enough information on Google and I can ask the Chat GPT to propose bibliographic sources in where you can find complete and useful information.	"Tasks such as summarizing a video on YouTube because it is true that it is ""artificial intelligence"" but it cannot always be right"	Very useful and effective, it does not cause me so much stress to look for information for hours.	Once it starts, it becomes part of, but in a certain way it is not so good since it would generate dependence on it and we could not be able to look for information for ourselves.
Estudiante	Facultad de Comunicación, Lingüística y Literatura	17-24 años	no lo uso,	1	No	It is a tool that can be used to help in the investigation and solution of doubts, about various topics	I have never used chatgpt, I have no use for this tool	I have not used chatgpt, I have no situation in which it is not useful to me	None	In my experience it has not influenced in any way
Estudiante	Facultad de Enfermería	17-24 años	Ninguno,	1	No	It seems to me that it is a system that tries to dominate and about passing human intelligence, leaving in ignorance the students who use it.	In none.	In all.	I do not see the need to use it.	He has created a great impact, since most students use to obtain short -term responses and avoid prolonged investigation.
Estudiante	Facultad de Economía	17-24 años	Computadora,	3	No	It is very useful to get relevant information on certain topics, but not to use it as a replacement in performing tasks.

Estudiante	Direcciones Administrativas	17-24 años	Teléfono móvil,	8	No	It is a good tool that simplifies processes	When creating a web page it is no longer necessary to have to know all the source codes since Chat GPT can give a general source code to develop from that point any website or application.

Estudiante	Facultad de Comunicación, Lingüística y Literatura	17-24 años	Computadora,Teléfono móvil,	2	Si	I consider that it is useful when being able to take ideas or clues about some investigations. However, I do not consider that it is a reliable source for the diversity of information that can be obtained through this tool. Additional, it does not always provide adequate information.	When I need to introduce some argument into an essay.	It becomes ineffective when more current information is required. You can confuse some data or give some unnecessary.	Honestly, I have tried to make use of this tool, but it has not turned out because in my career I need to speak or apply matter to my personal life or based on my experiences. On those occasions I did not favor and gave up the idea of ​​using. However, for some essays I tried to use it to be able to take ideas of arguments, it helped me but I reached out those arguments through other inquiries.	I consider that it is a good tool that must be developed and used in favor so that in the future there is no dependence of it.
Estudiante	Facultad de Psicología	17-24 años	Computadora,	3	No	It seems to me an excellent tool	I do not use in tasks	I do not use in tasks	For topics research	Positively
Estudiante	Facultad de Jurisprudencia	17-24 años	Teléfono móvil,Computadora,	1	No	I have not used frequently	academic	social	I have not used frequently	good
Estudiante	Facultad de Ciencias Exactas y Naturales	17-24 años	Computadora,Teléfono móvil,	6	No	It seems very good tool, if used well. In other words, being responsible with its use, use it as assistant but not to do any work.	When I need more information on a topic or I don't remember any command.	Sometimes in mathematical operations it is confused. It is not useful when needing sources, since it only has access to files until 2021.	Good, it helps me to understand some things.	For good.
Estudiante	Facultad de Enfermería	17-24 años	Computadora,	5	No	Very good	In few	In summaries	good	good
Estudiante	Facultad de Psicología	17-24 años	Teléfono móvil,	2	No	It is an important but not very effective tool	To find information	essays	Normal	No
Estudiante	Facultad de Ciencias Administrativas y Contables	17-24 años	Computadora,Teléfono móvil,	8	No	It is a very useful tool when it comes to wanting to find specific information quickly.	In research, writing and reflection tasks	Duties that have to do with numbers.	Very good.

Profesor	Facultad de Enfermería	55-64 años	Computadora,	1	No	very good. But in my case I only give a theory and I am alone occasional, so I do not give priority to the correct handling of the chatgpt.	I think if I put into practice, it will be very useful for tasks	I think it will be useful in all tasks	N/A	I have to practice this chatgpt
Estudiante	Facultad de Ciencias Administrativas y Contables	17-24 años	Nunca he accedido,	1	No	I have never used it	I have never used it	I have never used it	I have never used it	I have never used it
Estudiante	Facultad de Ciencias Administrativas y Contables	17-24 años	Computadora,	2	No	I think it is a tool that can help you have another perspective or improve your point of view with more arguments.	To find examples or put a more complete context of some discussion topic.	The few times that I have used it served me, it should be emphasized that it is necessary to ask the question well so that it can answer us.	Well, of great help when joining it with what I already had investigated, it also helps save time.	Positively since, a complemented with other things I did not know.
Estudiante	Facultad de Psicología	17-24 años	Teléfono móvil,	5	No	The AI ​​tool is very useful when there are creative blockages, solve doubts quickly and can even change the explanation if necessary. It is a tool that can be used as a guide to prepare jobs and not leave all the task in charge since it can tend to errors or misunderstand the orders.	It has been useful for the correction of texts, one can write to give the thesis and write in the best way but there are times when one cannot be clearly understood, so the chat can help or suggest changes in some texts To facilitate your understanding.	It would be a more complete tool if you could access the references where the information gets to verify that the information is correct.	As a personal comment, it has helped me organize and save time in simple tasks, since sometimes the requirements of some tasks are basic things but that consume a long time. The tool is effective if one considers it as a partner who has more experience that can help you in the tasks but will not give you the complete job.	Its influence is positive since on several occasions results are obtained that please teachers, it is like walking in a forest with a flashlight that gives you a better guide and allows you to advance faster. There are subjects or situations in which students are blindly having to repeat a task several times because professor does not clearly imply or the right time is given to answer doubts. It should be noted that a mediocre student will deliver mediocre tasks even using the chat GTP for thinking that it is a tool that solves everything, so a task is trusted and delivers below the average. On the part of the teachers I consider that they can use the tool to find creative ways to explain the class without the need to think for hours how to attract students, the chat can give simple examples and modify them according to the target group. Instead of worrying if it is a good or bad tool, the objective would be implemented correctly in the educational field to acquire new knowledge with greater efficiency and effectiveness.

Estudiante	Facultad de Ciencias Administrativas y Contables	17-24 años	Computadora,Teléfono móvil,	2	No	It is a good tool for simple research papers, to give a critical and complex opinion it does not work, that without counting that it does not have bibliography or a simple investigation.	Research about new class issues	In extensive works or complex research as an internationalization plan	Not very good	Negatively
Estudiante	Facultad de Enfermería	17-24 años	Computadora,	2	No	USEFUL	ESSAYS	RESEARCH	GOOD	It has not influenced
Estudiante	Facultad de Medicina	17-24 años	Computadora,	1	No	It is good, but it incapacitates you to do things for yourself.	Chemistry since it helps to have more than one clear response to concerns.

Estudiante	Facultad de Jurisprudencia	17-24 años	Computadora,	3	No	It is very good for academic issues	ESSAYS	Deep investigations or laws from other countries.	Very good, for the free version, it is very good.	In a field from 1 to 10, a 3 because the information is very wide.
Profesor	Facultad de Ciencias Administrativas y Contables	55-64 años	Computadora,Teléfono móvil,	2	No	At the moment, I have only used the free version, I think it contains too many inaccuracies, therefore, it must be used as a reference or location orientation of the required information, mainly.	Academic and Professional Consultations	For estimation or prediction of data that come from this chatbot.	Students state that the information provided is ambiguous and imprecise.	It is presented as an interesting immediate consultation option, considering that the information obtained must be valid by other arbitrated academic sources.
Estudiante	Facultad de Enfermería	35-44 años	Ninguna,	1	No	Within studies about the use of artificial intelligence I think it is convenient that its use can be like any other tool to which you have access. However, it should be emphasized that like every tool, it can be useful, without involving the development of thought and the ability of human being to think or reflect. That is what makes us identify as human beings.	I have not used it	Does not apply	Does not apply	Does not apply
Estudiante	Facultad de Enfermería	25-34 años	Computadora,	3	No	I like it because some topic that I do not understand and it is quite long summarizes it and allows me to understand it in a better way and with examples.	In tasks that I do not understand certain words because not heard or not read. Also in issues that are very complex to understand because they are very long and when I consult in the chat they already give me a basis to be able to understand in a better way and start investigating a little more to do an excellent job.	"My career is more practical, so the chat GPT is not usually so useful in that field, but in a way it is in great help and allows me to understand some things related to the practical part.
"	It is very good because it usually gives tips to better understand some issues of certain subjects that are complicated, my method of study through Chat GPT is more found, so it has allowed me to get better grades in my oral, practical and theoretical tests .	Wonderful because I have allowed me to find things faster and do not lose hours in a library, however, if I want to know more about the subject, more sources or book names usually recommend to have a broader knowledge of the subject and so I can learn further.
Estudiante	Facultad de Medicina	17-24 años	Computadora,	1	No	It is a very useful tool when giving us information that we are looking for for a long time.	In almost all the subjects I took within my career.	On certain occasions, Chat GPT is very useful rare is not to help you with information.	N/A	N/A
Estudiante	Facultad de Comunicación, Lingüística y Literatura	17-24 años	Computadora,	5	No	Super necessary but for aspects of great importance.	When I want to use synonyms in some prayer but do not change the meaning of this.

Estudiante	Facultad de Comunicación, Lingüística y Literatura	17-24 años	Computadora,Teléfono móvil,	3	No	Giving a brief opinion about such a controversial issue is difficult, but, in essence, I consider that this instrument - like all creations of technology, especially contemporary - have brought more discomfort than well -being. Chatgpt is a potential tool to strengthen knowledge, but unfortunately most people use it so that, by little, solve the problems of their lives. Chatgpt, instead of creating superhombres, is generating a crowd of inoperative mind. Indeed, this is not doing anything but exponentially to people, specifically of Latam. If in this continent, cases of Creole liveliness and negligence within the work framework are common, this will only aggravate this problem. Think, p. eg, what would be to be subjected to surgery by someone who used this tool to perform all his thesis. In conclusion, Chatgpt, in theory - or at least only in sensible people - works wonderfully: it is literally the pill to create intellectually powerful men, But, in praxis, it is nothing more than the intensifier of human idiocy and the imminent collapse of industrial society. As HP Lovecraft said, «so far the sciences, each oriented in its own direction, have caused us little damage, But someday, the reconstruction of scattered knowledge will make us know so terrible panoramic views of reality, and the terrifying of the place we occupy in it, that we can only go crazy as a result of such revelation, or flee from the deadly light to peace and security of a new era of darkness ».	only in the most specific or to have a general idea of ​​some subject, Or when I want to try to make Jailbreak asking him about ethical and epistemological issues.	Chatgpt is useful for countless activities, especially academics, but, at least personally, I try not to make use of it to strive and be intellectually stronger and more productive (and thus not sing songs of the very bad rabbit).	So far I have reluctantly used it only twice because, because of the hustle and daily, I almost forget them, so I consider that I do not know if I have an experience with Chatgpt within the U as such.	I honestly use it very rarely or when I get meditated (or troll mode) regarding what can answer me about truly interesting issues. But, as I say, I am trying to avoid using these tools, although I think that in the long run I will make a lot of use of these due to the status quo of today (because there is no need to be idealistic).
Estudiante	Facultad de Ciencias Administrativas y Contables	17-24 años	Computadora,	5	No	It is a very useful tool to have more information on the subject.

For tasks where information is needed to be very specific and that there are not many sources of information.	To solve tasks that involve the elaboration of graphics or diagrams.	Very good	Mostly positively because it allows me to be more efficient when looking for solutions for specific problems but also in a certain negative way because it is creating some dependence.

Estudiante	Facultad de Medicina	17-24 años	Computadora,	1	No	I understand is a useful tool for the search and comparison of information, either from putting together a presentation for class to building the theoretical framework of a thesis.	Related to research fundamentals.	Inquiry tasks, creation of mental maps, etc.	It has been satisfactory, since it has helped me to search very specific information and to synthesize it so that it is assimilable and objective.

Estudiante	Facultad de Psicología	17-24 años	Computadora,	4	No	It is extremely useful, synthesizes and facilitates work by providing us accurate research to about the topic as requested, eliminated from the equation the waste of time required by looking for papers or PDFs on the Internet. It facilitates these documents with the specifications that one requires and releases more time from the student to be able to study the content that would be the truly functional part.	When you need to use very specific topics research	Ideograms, workshops	Very good, I am very facilitated to find useful information.	I have more enjoyable and efficient.
Estudiante	Facultad de Ciencias Filosófico – Teológicas	17-24 años	Computadora,	1	No	It is an artificial intelligence that although it knows things in general, it is not able to formulate issues that help us academically develop in the faculty. Therefore, this artificial intelligence tool cannot compare or match the action of reading books and highlight the authors' thinking with personal critical thinking.	"Personally, I put it up with book comparison questions that are often not very exhibited, and throws a totally contradictory result to the expected. Therefore, I do not recommend using these types of applications to ""facilitate life."" Finally, it must be noted that these artificial intelligence systems do not have constant information update, so their data is prior to 2019."	Comparison of texts and books.	Almost nil because I don't use it.	It means to put aside reading and critical thinking, therefore, we should not resort to these antimorales practices in terms of the learning process.

Estudiante	Facultad de Medicina	17-24 años	Computadora,	4	No	It is a useful tool to have general ideas of any subject and obtain an explanation of a complex topic whose concept is not very clear, an adequate use of this tool greatly benefits development in the academic field	In tasks that require statistical or rare information associated with our environment as common pathologies or nutritional aspects	Tasks that require systematizing information or in case of questions that are not easily found in other places, it is useful for guiding more specific searches in other places	It has been a means of support to optimize the available time facilitating the study of complex and extensive issues, however, it is important to consider that you can make mistakes so that information with reliable bibliography should always be supported	With the development of artificial intelligence today it is possible that the academic and labor environment to a large extent is drastically changed is the only tool available today
Estudiante	Facultad de Medicina	17-24 años	Computadora,	8	No	Good	Give ideas to carry out activities or duties	It does not serve well for multiple choice questions or if you do not give a context appropriate to something	Good	To influence positively by helping me in several things and to understand others

Estudiante	Facultad de Ciencias Administrativas y Contables	17-24 años	Computadora,	1	No	The truth, I have never used that tool, however, within the comments that certain people close to me have done, I sincerely feel that this tool is being misused in the educational environment, it should be taken as additional help as artificial intelligence for benefit of knowledge, but not promoting mediocrity and simple work.	In none	In all my tasks	I have not used	Students having this tool, have set aside asynchronous education, and now they only seek facilism when performing their tasks, which generates many gaps in learning.

Estudiante	Facultad de Enfermería	17-24 años	Computadora,	1	No	Well, everyone has talked about this tool, both teachers and students, so I think it is very useful for certain research, of course people copy everything textually, which is not correct and that also the sources of consultation may not be appropriate	I have not come to use chatgpt	I have not come to use chatgpt	I have not come to use chatgpt	I have not come to use chatgpt, but if I got to use it, I think it would influence negatively since it tends to facilism

Estudiante	Facultad de Medicina	17-24 años	Computadora,Teléfono móvil,	8	No	Amazing, right? That emotion of knowing that your task will be done in seconds, that essay in which the entire semester made in a minute had to be worked on, realize that you are not exploiting your mind as you should, and finally look in the mirror, realize that you are actually using this new wonder of the world against you. In some near future knowledge, the years of study, curious data, reasoning, it will only be a matter of searching in a browser. Frightening.	"Looking at the sidewalk, seeing those broken headlights, the street in its worst conditions, a rat decomposing, and there I was looking in the mirror, the small details that changed, how many unveils have passed?
Reach your house, your bed little fixed, your messy desk, yesterday's food, and just bed, sleep, get 3 am to a new day. Realize that the procrastination, vagrancy and tiredness manifested in your being, open your computer search chatgpt, and just copy and paste. It facilitates life, but what is the use of that duty that sent, that lesson, that endless research, if you only copy and will not help.

Everything counts, every thing we do, every page we read, every article we review, everything counts at all, for better or worse."	In all.	Disastrous I love him, but hurts me.	"Too much, every thing, every detail, every particle.

Estudiante	Facultad de Ingeniería	17-24 años	Computadora,Teléfono móvil,	8	Si	I consider that it is a fairly useful tool, however, it is wise not to abuse this and make everything perform, there must be a balance between its good use and exploitation. I consider that otherwise the intellectual abilities of people can be reduced.	I have found it useful when finding new perspectives based on what I have, to guide me in studies and in my life.	I do not consider that the use of chatgpt for extensive projects is useful, for jobs that require personal opinions or to make entire applications such as many people believe.	I have used chatgpt mostly to guide myself in studies but also to do homework, but not as it is thought, but, I use it to investigate and also collect useful sources.

Estudiante	Facultad de Comunicación, Lingüística y Literatura	17-24 años	Computadora,Teléfono móvil,	4	Si	The tool is much less threatening for our modern life as the media shows it, it is basically a steroid search engine	It is quite useful to summarize texts or to suggest creative ideas or arguments about general issues	"The model (for free access) is trained with web information more than 2 years ago, which makes it quite useless to deal with current issues, in addition to not having a verification model, it is also able to deliver wrong or ""hallucinated"" information following the way in which information processes relevant averages"	In general it is a very useful referential tool, it can save a lot of time when initiating research or consulting simple questions about countless topics. Despite this, the model has difficulties in the specific details of these issues, especially in the Spanish language. Do not be fooled by media hysteria, the tool is not as useful for university plagiarism as the majority believe, these tools will raise ravages in many sectors but moment education seems to be sure	The impact on educational experience is much less than one imaginary at first. Yes, the tool saves a barbarity of time when writing simple texts but, this idea that students can only take the instructions of our work and ask Chatgpt to do them without anyone realizing it is something quite remote Of reality and without the mood of offending, I think it is born from a total unemployment of what this technology is. The truth is that the few occasions in which one can depend completely on something like chatgpt are simple reproduction or consultation work and for years there have been much better and more complete tools for those who want to be vague, but the majority, like chatgpt or copy & paste as in times of yesteryear they fall for the same problem, it simply does not sound like ourselves, if a teacher can be deceived by 100% work done by ChatGPT can also be deceived by copying a work from any other side.
Estudiante	Facultad de Enfermería	17-24 años	Teléfono móvil,	1	No	It is a very useful tool.	When I don't know about the subject.	None	Good.	It has not significantly influenced.
Estudiante	Facultad de Arquitectura, Diseño y Artes	17-24 años	Computadora,	3	No	Currently, I find Chatgpt as a tool that is limited to delivering basic information, without more. There is no real reflection or comparisons at deep knowledge levels. I consider that their current abilities are comparable to those of any search engine such as Google, but a little more advanced by the fact of summarizing the results it finds on the Internet. However, and despite its limitations, in the short term I am convinced that it will develop to the point of being able to make complex analysis and comparisons. And it is likely that, at that point, the current education system must change and finally modernize, to guarantee adequate learning to today's world. And the solution will not be closed to new technologies, but perhaps to apply them and change the evaluation form only on appreciating a note, to really appreciate knowledge and learning. In conclusion, Chatgpt's capabilities are currently not really useful, more than to make basic summaries of Internet pages. You don't have to worry (at least for now).	To find basic initial information	Chatgpt does not generate any type of reflection, and information is usually extremely ambiguous	It is very useful as a basic search engine that summarizes a lot of information, but ambiguously. Therefore it is only useful in a first stage, as well as to have a general idea about the subject.	It has generated knowledge at an initial stage. Yes, I am satisfied with the tool.
Estudiante	Facultad de Ciencias Administrativas y Contables	17-24 años	Computadora,	1	No	Makes students try to read or search for sources with bibliography	So far I have not used it and I don't think so in the future either	Always	I have not used it, but it gives me the impression that the university is not about, but to understand a concept and capture it with its own words, otherwise it is simply a copy	Personally I do not like and I feel that the people who use it simply do not strive enough, if it were an intelligence that gives me the most reliable results ok but with bibliography and a small paraphrase, not a transcribed idea.
Estudiante	Facultad de Ciencias Exactas y Naturales	17-24 años	Computadora,	1	No	It is good and if they prohibit them they are the worst university in the world	In none because it is very outdated for my matter	In my daily tasks	There is no how to use the Wifi of the U is very ugly	He has not influenced anything and does not prohibit her by FA

Estudiante	Facultad de Medicina	25-34 años	Computadora,Teléfono móvil,	10	Si	It is an excellent tool that can serve a lot as help for certain tasks, logically without neglecting your own criteria, that is, not to depend completely on it but to use it as a complement to facilitate and save time in some specific tasks.

"When I am studying a topic and I want to complement some knowledge or it is costing me to understand a concept I request to Chat GPT to explain better.
